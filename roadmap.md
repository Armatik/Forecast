# Roadmap
## Feature I'll add in the future.
(not in chronological order)
<ul>
  <li>Separate page with much more detailed weather info. It will contain also graphs for temperature trend.</li>
  <li>I'd like to add all the features of <a href="https://gitlab.com/bitseater/meteo">meteo</a>, like global radar, wind, meteosat etc... An example website with all those info is 
    <a href="http://www.persicetometeo.com/">persicetometeo</a></li>
</ul>

And more things I'll come up in the future!
